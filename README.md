Similar Apps and Design Inspiration: TaskMaster draws inspiration from popular to-do list apps like Todoist, Wunderlist, and Microsoft To Do. We aim to combine the best features of these apps while adding unique functionalities such as task categorization, sorting, priority management, and the Today Page to provide users with a comprehensive task management experience.

Scope and Usability: TaskMaster will offer a user-friendly interface with essential task management features, including task creation, categorization, sorting, and priority management. The addition of the Today Page will provide users with a quick overview of tasks scheduled for the day. The app will prioritize usability, ensuring smooth navigation and intuitive interactions for users. Additionally, TaskMaster will leverage Firebase APIs for seamless user authentication and data storage, enhancing the overall user experience.
